**Project Overview**

The customer of this project is FutureProduct Advisors, a consultancy that helps their customers develop innovative and new consumer products. FutureProduct’s customers are increasingly seeking help from their consultants in go-to-market activities. 
FutureProduct’s consultants have the skills to support these go-to-market activities, but the business does not have all the infrastructure needed to support them.

The most consistent request from the FutureProduct consultants is a tool that helps them find interesting, up-and-coming music to accompany social posts and online ads for go-to-market promotions. They often spend hours searching for music that is catchy, interesting, and not overly popular.

The goal of this work is to create 2 machine learning models:

1. A model that can predict the highest ranking a given song will reach on the Billboard Hot 100 list (a measure of overall song popularity)
2. A model that can predict the largest increase in ranking on the Billboard Hot 100 list a song will achieve (a measure of a song's catchiness)

The data source for this project was assembled from the Billboard Hot 100 list and metadata from Spotify.

This repository contains:

1. MH_DS_Capstone_Proj2.ipynb: the working document for this project. All data manipulation, cleaning, and modeling are contained within.
2. genre_counts.csv and genre_counts_50+inst.csv: two lists used to evaluate and limit the genres of music used in the analysis.
3. MH_DS_Capstone_Proj2_Pt1.pdf: a project brief outlining the initial plan and goals for this work.
